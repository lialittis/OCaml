# Tuple

A n-tuple is an ordered sequence of n values written i parenthesis and separated by commas as (expr, expr,...,expr).

For instance, (42,"hello",true) is a 3-truple that contains the integer 42 as its first component, the string "hello" as its second component, and the boolean value true as its third component.

Note that n can be 0, which gives the empty tuple(). This is called "unit" in OCaml.

## addition

Notice that, a function has to have one parameter, at least a unit. For example,

print\_newline ();;
