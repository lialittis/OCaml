(*Integer Identifiers*)

(*Suppose that a variable X exists and is an integer*)
(*Define a variable x_power_8 that uses three multiplications to calculate x to the power of 8. The only function your are allowed is the "*" operator*)
(*Hint: use auxiliary variables*)


let x = Random.int 9+1;;(* not 0 *)

(*first test*)

let x_power_8 = x*x*x*x*x*x*x*x;;
