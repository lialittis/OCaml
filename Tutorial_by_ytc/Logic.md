# Natural deduction

## Introduction

### Propositional logic

In propositional logic, we consider formulas which are built from 

* variables: X, Y...
* connectives: 


The boolean interpretation:

Usually, we interpre variables as booleans

## Natrual deduction



### rules

* elimination
* introduction

There is no introduction of false and elimination of true



## Proofs

A proof is a tree formed with the derivation rules of NJ.

### Definable conncetives

<=>   =  => and <=

\neg A =  A => false


### Induction on proofs



* weakening

* contraction

* exchange

* strenthing

true in the context has no information



### Substitution

assigns a formula to every variable



## Cut elimination
